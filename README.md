# Optimal-Ship-Routing-and-Personal-Assignment-for-Naval-Recruitment-in-Thailand
Thailand navy recruits are drafted four times a year. A draftee reports to one of the 34 centers in a home locality and then transported by bus to one of four navy branch bases. From there, recruits are transported to the main naval base by ship. All trips originate and terminate at the main base. Three classes of ships are available. Each branch base has limited capacity to accommodate all the draftees.
