# Optimal-Ship-Routing-and-Personal-Assignment-for-Naval-Recruitment-in-Thailand
Thailand navy recruits are drafted four times a year. A draftee reports to one of the 34 centers in a home locality and then transported by bus to one of four navy branch bases. From there, recruits are transported to the main naval base by ship. All trips originate and terminate at the main base. Three classes of ships are available. Each branch base has limited capacity to accommodate all the draftees. 
--I have solved problem of "How should the draftees be transported by ship from branch naval bases to main base?"
by using Integer Programming model and also computed the voyages table by using ships data and distance matrix .

--I have solved problem of "How should the draftees be transported by ship from naval bases to main base by using minimum distance and minimum ships from each"
 by using minimal  spanning tree algorithms from the given data and constraints in base paper about voyages and path from every class.
 -For the problems Excel solver gives us results faster as compared to manually solving problems.
-Complex computations are done efficiently which are not possible manually.
